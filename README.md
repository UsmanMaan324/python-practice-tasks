Python practice questions solved by Usman Ali

Here we will solve the some less complex problem in python

# Task 1
Compute the sum of two provided numbers

    --> sum_of_two_number(5, 3)
        8
 
 # Task 2
 Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 1000
 and 2000 (both included)
 
 # Task 3
 With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains
 (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should
 print the dictionary.

    --> make_dict(8)
        {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

# Task 4
Define a class which has at least two methods:

**getString**: to get a string from console input
**printString**: to print the string in upper case.

Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.

# Task 5
Write a program that accepts string as input and prints the string after making
    all characters in the sentence capitalized.

     --> make_all_capital("hello")
        HELLO
        
 # Task 6
 Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.

    --> count_letters_and_digits("hello world! 123")
        LETTERS 10
        DIGITS 3

# Task 8
Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input
    by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.

    --> list = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
    --> square_odd_number_list(list)
        1,9,25,49,81
